### What is a database

- Base full of data
- Collection of organized data
- Table of data
- Efficient way to store a lot of information

### Why do we want to use a DBMS ?

- Big OBJ => Need to build helper functions, resets every time we restart
- Plaintext => Fs.readfile/writefile (JSON), build helper functions, non ACID compliant

- Relational databases (SQL) => helpers builtin, transaction, persistent (less easy share)
- Document driven databases (BSON) => Mongo, Firebase, Supabase
- Graph Databases => Based graph theory

=> Connect, interact easily

PostgreSQL => Server ?

PSQL => Client

Why do programmers mix hallowen and christmas => because OCT 31 === DEC 25

Decimal system => Base 10 , 0-9, 10

3x1 = 3
1x10 = 10

3 x 10^0 = 3
1 x 10^1 = 10

111

1 x 2^0 = 1
1 x 2^1 = 2
1 x 2^2 = 4

Octal base (8)

1 x 8^0 = 1
3 x 8^1 = 24
